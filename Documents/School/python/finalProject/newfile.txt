Christina was walking his pet named Bob through vancouver. When suddenly a wild Carina came out of nowhere! Christina reacted quickly by coding, which made him/her feel nice and they didnt want to be coding anymore. They called LaRhea who they showed up with a helicopter. So Christina lived to see another day
